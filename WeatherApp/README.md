# 🌤️ Weather App

A desktop application built in **Python** with **PyQt5**, using the **WeatherAPI** to deliver weather forecasts in a fast and optimized way. The project follows strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, implements local caching for assets (icons) to avoid unnecessary network requests, and features a responsive, modern graphical interface.

## Overview & Functionalitydetailed

This application is a practical desktop project designed to test API integration, JSON data parsing, image asset caching, and GUI creation using Qt.

- **Core Feature:** The user inputs a specific location. Upon submission, the app dynamically extracts the location name, country, and current local time.
- **Forecast Display:** The application displays the current weather data for today plus a 6-day forward forecast (7 days total).
- **Data Optimization:** Because the API's full forecast payload is massive (containing hourly data), the application parses and displays only the essential daily summary: maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, alongside the general weather condition status and corresponding visual icons.

## User Interface (Qt)

The graphical user interface was initially designed visually using Qt Designer and some details were changed through code.

        │   ├── locationLabel
        │   ├── locationInput
        │   └── searchButton
        │
        ├── locationInfoLabel (Metadata: City, Country, and Local Time)

            ├── card_2 (Tomorrow's Forecast)
            ├── ...
            └── card_7 (7th Day Forecast)
```

### Key UI Workflows

- **Location Lookup:** The user types a city name into `locationInput` and clicks `searchButton` or `return` key. The `local` value (e.g., `"aveiro"`) is used to update the query parameters.
- **Automatic Location Detection:** The "Current Location" menu item/button uses utility services to detect the user's coordinates or IP address and perform the lookup automatically.
- **JSON Data Extraction:** Parses the nested JSON response to extract string values for the location name, country, and local time, as well as array data for the 7 forecast days.
- **Forecast Cards:** Each of the 7 forecast cards displays:
  - The corresponding day of the week.
  - Expected maximum, minimum, and average temperatures.
  - The weather condition icon (loaded locally via the cache manager).
  - The general condition status (e.g., "Light rain", "Sunny").
- **Visual Layout:** Organizes text data and pairs them with their locally-cached weather icons across the dashboard.

## Project Structure

The folder and file organization follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern to decouple business logic, interface, and data-consuming services.

## API Architecture

While WeatherAPI offers multiple endpoints (such as `/current.json`, `/search.json`, `/history.json`, and `/alerts.json`), this application exclusively implements the **Forecast** method to gather all required real-time and future data in a single request — reducing latency and network traffic.

### Implemented API Method

- **Endpoint:** `/forecast.json`
- **Purpose:** Used to retrieve both the current local metadata and the upcoming 7-day weather outlook.

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | Yes | Your unique WeatherAPI developer key. |
| `q` | Yes | The query location parameter, passed dynamically based on the user's city choice (e.g., `q={local}`). |
| `days` | No | Set to `7` to fetch today's weather and the 6 subsequent days. |
| `aqi` | No | Air Quality Index flag. Set to `no` to keep data payloads light. |
| `alerts` | No | Weather alerts flag. Set to `no` since severe alerts are not required for this implementation. |

#### Dynamic Request Example

```python
f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key={api_key}&q={local}&days=7&aqi=no&alerts=no"
```

## Image Asset Management (Icons Cache)

To display weather conditions visually without degrading application performance, the project includes a dedicated component called `icons_manager`.

- **The Problem:** Each weather state comes with an icon URL from the API. Making a network request to download the image file every single time the UI refreshes would flood the network and slow down the interface.
- **The Solution (`icons_manager`):**
  1. Extracts the icon asset link from the API's JSON response.
  2. Checks if the image file already exists in the local `icons/` directory.
  3. **Cache Miss:** If the image is not local, it downloads the raw binary content of the icon and saves it locally.
  4. **Cache Hit:** If the image already exists locally, it skips the network entirely and loads it immediately.
  5. Finally, it renders the image smoothly inside the Qt application layout.
